Functional Programming is a progamming paradigm (Worldwiew/mindset) - & there are many others

## Imperative

- understanding the world of computing as a series of commands.
- Follow my commpands
- Do this, then that
- is in contrast with Declarative
- OOP is one

### Object Oriented

- imperative mindset
- keep state to yourself / keep to themselves
- sends and receives messages by calling methods on other objects in the program
- encapsulated units (cellular objects)

"The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result." [Wiki Imperative Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming)

## Declarative

- this I what I want
- do it however you want
- instead of giving a list of commands (imperative) we tell it what we want and let the computer do the computation for us
- SQL is a declarative query language

### Functional

- one simple idea **Pure Functions**
