You know you’re a great developer for the job, but how do you prove it to your interviewers? It can be challenging to feel confident in web development technical interviews. In this course, instructor Emma Bostian equips you with the problem solving skills you need to ace your web developer interviews. Emma doesn’t focus on teaching computer science or web development topics. Instead, she teaches you how to use the skills you already have to solve technical problems. Emma uses a series of challenges to give you real-world practice and walk you through how to ask clarifying questions, architect your first solution, optimize your code, and test for edge cases.
